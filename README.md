# Eyes

## Description

This project meant as practice to manipulating the DOM and having DOM elements interact with the mouse movement. 

Take a look at the demo on my portfolio page [here](https://lukas-dh.github.io/04_eyes/index.html).

## Installation

You can run this application in your broswer by simply downloading the files in one folder and opening the index.html  

## Future improvements

The eyes center when the mouse is at screen center rather than between the eyes when run on a small non centered div. I plan to fix that.
